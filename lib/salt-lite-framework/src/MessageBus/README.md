# Message Bus

The message bus is a simple implementation of the message bus pattern. It allows for the decoupling of components in a
system by allowing them to communicate through messages. This allows for a more flexible and scalable system.

This is the component that is responsible for enqueueing, dequeuing, and processing queue jobs.
